# Project: I Am Learning Python

### Flashy - Flash Card App
Flashy is a simple and interactive flash card application built with Python and Tkinter. It helps you learn new languages by showing you words on one side (French) and their translations (English). You can mark words as known or unknown, and the app keeps track of the words that you need to learn, saving your progress.

Features:
- Interactive Flash Cards: Learn French (or any other language) by testing your knowledge with flash cards.
- Track Your Progress: Mark words as known, and the app will save which words need more practice.
- Sleek UI with Tkinter: User-friendly design with smooth transitions between cards.
- Automatic Progress Saving: Your progress is saved automatically in CSV format, so you can continue where you left off.
